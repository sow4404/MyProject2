<h3> Water talkie</h3>
<div>
<p> In 1996, a fifth grader named Richie Stachowski invented the water talkie, a device that allows people to talk to each other underwater.
Who knows how it works, since you can't talk to each other underwater normally! </p>

<h3> Corner frames </h3>
<div>
<p> Corner frames are a new way of accessorizing your home. Basically, it's a photograph frame that wraps around a corner, using magnets and
quite possibly a little bit of magic. They look quite interesting, so if you want to let people see only part of your picture, but from 
more angles, feel free to get these. </p>

<h3> Rolling Benches </h3>
<div>
<p> Quite simply, it's a bench with a gear handle on the side that allows you to rotate the seat of the bench. So when it rains, you just
need to rotate the seat and voila! A dry seat for your tush! Neither the company that makes it nor the developers of this webpage are
responsible for any damage occurred when a crazy younger sibling rotates the bench when you are sitting in it. All hypothetically, of 
course. </p>

<h3>The coolest pen EVER </h3>
<div>
<p> Ok, so both of the developers were completely in awe of this pen when they saw this. It looks like a normal pen, except the end that
you don't write with is abnormally large. But, you use the abnormally large section and point it at different things. The large part is
actually a scanner, and it basically absorbs the color of the object that you're scanning. Then-here's the cool part-when you write
using the pen, it writes using the color of the object that you scanned! Much better than a normal pen, with only one color. That's
soooooo 2017 </p>
