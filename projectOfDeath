<h3>Create a Vaccuum Day - February 4th</h3>
<div>
<p>No one is really sure about the EXACT meaning of this holiday, but Create a Vaccuum Day Enthusiasts have widely accepted two theories:
Theory 1: A housewife got frustrated with her vaccuuming chores, and decided to assemble a militia of other housewives to create Create a
Vaccuum Day. Why did they make it CREATE a vaccuum day? The answer to this is simple. They figured that if they made the holiday
confusing enough, people would be so busy trying to figure out what the holiday was that they wouldn't notice that the housewives were
abandoning their vaccuuming duties.
Theory 2: A mad scientist created this day. Why? Because he's mad, and thinks that the creation of this day could result in a black hole
that would suck up the earth. Mad scientists enjoy thinking about this concept.</p>

<h3>National Grapefruit Month - February</h3>

<h3>National Ballpoint Pen Day - June 10</h3>
<div>
<p>On June 10, 1943, the first patent for the ballpoint pen was filed. And it's a good thing, too, or else we would still be furiously
and frequently dipping a quill plucked from a poor, unfortunate bird into an inkwell and writing a single letter, then angstily dipping
the quill BACK into the inkwell for <i>yet more ink.</i></p>
